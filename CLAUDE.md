# Nibli

A Zero-Hallucination Symbolic Reasoning Engine.

Nibli is a deterministic theorem prover compiled to WebAssembly (WASI P2). It compiles Lojban natural language syntax into First-Order Logic and performs inference via demand-driven backward-chaining over an indexed fact store. Every conclusion is a formal derivation from the facts + rules you assert, under a closed-world + closed-domain assumption (compute-backend results are trusted as axioms); nothing is fabricated. A `FALSE` verdict means "not derivable," not "proved ¬P". (README's "What zero-hallucination means here" has the full scoping.)

## Environment

- **OS:** Ubuntu on WSL2 (accessed from Windows via `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\...`)
- **Dev shell:** Nix flake — all tools (rustc, cargo-component, wac, just, wasmtime) come from `flake.nix`
- **Enter dev shell:** `nix develop --extra-experimental-features nix-command --extra-experimental-features flakes`
- **Run commands from Windows side:** `wsl -d Ubuntu -e bash -lc "cd ~/projects/dhilipsiva/nibli && nix ... develop --command bash -c '<CMD>'"`
- **Set `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`** if running cargo from Windows side (filesystem lock issues)

## Build & Test

All commands must run inside the Nix dev shell. Use `just` as the primary task runner (see `Justfile`):

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `just run` | Full pipeline: clean WASM -> build lasna component -> launch REPL |
| `just check` | Fast type-check all workspace crates (`cargo check --workspace`) |
| `just test` | Run all unit tests (`cargo test --lib -- --nocapture --test-threads=1`) |
| `just test-engine` | Run nibli-engine integration tests (full pipeline: parse → compile → reason) |
| `just test-gerna` | Run gerna (parser) tests only |
| `just test-backend` | Run Python backend tests |
| `just test-gasnu` | Run gasnu host unit tests (trap classification, error/verdict formatting, arithmetic) |
| `just test-all` | Run every test suite (unit + integration + Python) |
| `just ci` | Fast native CI gate (fmt-check, clippy, all native test suites incl. `test-gasnu` + `verify-soundness` + `verify-parser` + `verify-proofs`). No WASM build. |
| `just verify-soundness` | Differential soundness gate (Track A), **two oracles**: **(1) Vampire** (classical FOL) over the Horn/NAF-free fragment — curated cases (incl. ground `du`-equality, mapped to TPTP native `=` so congruence closure matches nibli's union-find in both directions), a seeded batch of random Horn programs with mixed-in `du` links (`NIBLI_VERIFY_RANDOM_COUNT`, default 200; `nibli-verify --random N` for a manual sweep), and the auto-extracted mappable slice of the `gdpr`/`ddi` corpora; **(2) clingo** (ASP/Datalog) over the stratified-NAF + closed-world fragment Vampire can't cover — a curated NAF corpus (incl. the real `gdpr.lojban:101` deontic-NAF erasure rule: `se bilga` is a plain gismu and the `lo nu` abstraction is modeled as an opaque constant keyed by its `__abs_<hash>`; and `du`×NAF cases — the translator canonicalizes `du`-equivalence classes to representative constants, covering the NAF-through-equality shape) + random stratified-NAF programs (`NIBLI_VERIFY_NAF_RANDOM_COUNT`, default 100; `nibli-verify --asp [--random N]`), where nibli's closed-world verdict must equal clingo's unique stable/perfect model. Tense flavors (`pu`/`ca`/`ba`) are covered by both oracles via the flavorization pre-pass (`nibli-verify/src/tense.rs`: flavor-suffixed predicates; unmarked rules instantiated per occurring flavor; explicit tenses pinned). Exact-count queries (`PA lo X cu Y`) are covered by the ASP oracle as `#count` aggregates over ground-fact KBs (curated + random, `NIBLI_VERIFY_COUNT_RANDOM_COUNT`, default 100). Conservatively skipped: non-ground / negated / numeric `du`; tense×NAF (the engine's `NegatedExistsGroup` is tenseless — not canonized); tense×abstraction; count×rules (the xorlo import witness gets counted) and count×du (classes uncollapsed) — both pending the count-semantics decision (`filter::count_case_guard`). Plus a **(3) non-stratified-rejection differential** (`strat_diff.rs`) — seeded random rule programs asserted rule-by-rule; every accept/reject decision must match an independent implementation of the proven criterion (written from the Lean statement, never from `rules.rs`; `NIBLI_VERIFY_STRAT_RANDOM_COUNT`, default 300), with a post-rejection fresh-replay equivalence battery (a rejected rule leaves no trace); native-only, never skips. Plus a **(4) retraction metamorphic differential** (`retract_diff.rs`) — seeded random op sequences (ground/∃/rule/`du`/NAF asserts + retractions); after every retraction the incremental engine must equal a fresh replay of the survivors (retract ≡ never-asserted, both the O(1) and full-rebuild paths; `NIBLI_VERIFY_RETRACT_RANDOM_COUNT`, default 200); native-only, never skips. Plus a **(5) compiler-seam** check (`gerna_smuni_seam_conformance`, `nibli-verify/src/seam.rs`) — the front-end analog of the two oracle gates: compiles source Lojban text end-to-end (gerna→smuni) and checks the FOL against hand-verified structure (event decomposition + arg→role, `na`→¬, `.e`/`.a`→∧/∨, `ro lo`→∀-implication vs `lo`→∃-conjunction, `se`-swap) plus metamorphic pairs (`E se P F` ≡ `F P E`, canonicalized by positional var-rename) over a seeded batch; needs no solver, so it always runs. Needs `vampire` + `clingo` for oracles (1)+(2) (Nix shell; each side skips if its solver is absent). Part of `ci`. |
| `just verify-parser` | Parse-differential gate (front-end): every sentence gerna accepts (shipped corpora + seeded random batches from all three case generators) must parse under the official Lojban grammar — **ilmentufa camxes** driven via `node` (both provided by the Nix shell: `nodejs` + the pinned `ilmentufa` flake input, exported as `NIBLI_CAMXES_DIR`; skips cleanly if absent). One-directional (gerna implements a fragment, so gerna-rejects carry no signal); acceptance-level only (parse trees are not compared — the seam gate covers text-to-FOL structure). The `KNOWN_DIVERGENCES` allowlist (`nibli-verify/tests/parser_differential.rs`, still-diverging invariant) is currently empty — the five first-run divergences were fixed at the source (`.fenituin.`→`.fenitoin.` corpus rename; readme `je na`→official `jenai`, which gerna now parses along with `janai`/`jonai`/`junai`). Part of `ci`. |
| `just verify-proofs` | Mechanized-proof gate (Track B): check the Lean 4 soundness proofs in `proofs/` (needs `lean`, provided by the Nix shell; skips if absent). Part of `ci`. |
| `just ci-wasm` | WASM behavioral gate: build the lasna component + run the gasnu smokes (fuel exhaustion, post-trap recovery, go'i variants, persist-replay, NAF note, `:debug`, quiet mode, …) plus the three-way determinism legs: `smoke-gasnu-determinism` (the pinned `determinism-corpus.lojban` through the Wasmtime component) and `verify-wasm-node` (the same corpus through the wasm32-unknown-unknown build under node/V8 via wasm-pack; skips cleanly if wasm-pack is absent). The native leg (`determinism_corpus_native`) rides `verify-soundness`. |
| `just ci-all` | Comprehensive pre-push / pre-release gate: `ci` + `ci-wasm` |
| `just build-wasm` | Build single lasna WASM component |
| `just build-gasnu` | Build native Wasmtime host gasnu (runner) |
| `just backend` | Start the Python reference compute backend (port 5555) |
| `just run-with-backend` | Build + run with `NIBLI_COMPUTE_ADDR=127.0.0.1:5555` |
| `just ui` | Launch the standalone Transparency Triad web UI (Dioxus, port 8080) — engine runs fully in-browser |
| `just fetch-dict` | Download the lensisku English dictionary to `dictionary-en.json` (needs `LENSISKU_TOKEN`) — see Dictionary Data below |
| `just clean` | `cargo clean` |
| `just fuzz-parse [SECS]` | Fuzz gerna parser (libFuzzer via the Nix shell's pinned nightly, `NIBLI_NIGHTLY_BIN` — no rustup needed). Pass seconds to limit run time. |
| `just fuzz-assert [SECS]` | Fuzz nibli-engine assert_text (full pipeline) |
| `just fuzz-query [SECS]` | Fuzz nibli-engine assert + query (stateful KB; split-half input: first half asserted, second half queried) |
| `just fuzz-seed` | Seed `fuzz/corpus/` for all three targets from the shipped `.lojban` corpus files |
| `just fuzz-ci [SECS]` | Unattended fuzz gate: `fuzz-seed` + all three targets × SECS (default 120) each; non-zero on crash/OOM/leak (LeakSanitizer is ON — the arena AST is leak-free by invariant, see `gerna/src/ast.rs`). Runs as a parallel `fuzz` job in the GitHub workflow. |
| `just mutants [JOBS]` | Mutation-testing gate over the soundness paths (scope + per-mutant test set in `.cargo/mutants.toml`: logji/smuni/nibli-engine suites per mutant). Diffs survivors against `mutants-baseline.txt` (line:col-stripped): fails on any NEW survivor, prompts a shrink for killed ones. On-demand (~17 min full sweep), not in the per-push gate. Baseline + stats in GUARANTEES.md. |

**Important:**
- Always use `cargo test --lib` (NOT `cargo test`) — cdylib linker chokes on WIT export symbols containing `@`
  - Exception: `gasnu` is a normal bin (no cdylib/WIT export), so `cargo test -p gasnu` (the `test-gasnu` recipe, gated by `ci`) links fine; the `@` issue only affects `lasna`/the component crates.
- `ci` is the fast native gate (no WASM build). The WASM component + gasnu fuel/memory/trap-recovery behavior is gated by `ci-wasm` (the six smokes); run `ci-all` (= `ci` + `ci-wasm`) as the comprehensive pre-push gate.
- **Regenerate WIT bindings:** `cargo component build` (bindings appear in each crate's `src/bindings.rs`)
  - Note: full build fails on `io-extras` crate (`#![feature]` on stable). Bindings still generate successfully before the failure.
- **REPL uses reedline** — does not work with piped stdin
- Logji (reasoning) tests require `--test-threads=1` (shared global state via RefCell). The Justfile handles this.

## Dictionary Data

`smuni-dictionary` (arity + English gloss + place-frame for every gismu/lujvo/cmavo) is built
at compile time by `smuni-dictionary/build.rs`, which parses **`dictionary-en.json`** at the
repo root — the **lensisku** English bulk export (`lojban/lensisku`,
`DictionaryEntry`: a JSON array, one canonical entry per word, with `word`, `word_type`,
`definition` (place structure as `$x_{N}$` markers), and `gloss_keywords`). This replaced the
legacy reCAPTCHA-gated `jbovlaste-en.xml`.

- The file is **gitignored** and bulk-download needs a login token, so it is NOT in the repo.
  Get it with **`just fetch-dict`** (`export LENSISKU_TOKEN=<bearer token from lensisku.lojban.org>`)
  or download `dictionary-en.json` manually and drop it at the repo root.
- **Without the file** the build falls back to the in-tree `FALLBACK_GISMU_ENTRIES` +
  gloss/cmavo override tables (~140 curated entries) — this is exactly what CI uses, so CI
  needs no network/token. With the file you get the full dictionary — 10,907 entries in
  the current export (1,338 gismu, 8,308 lujvo, 1,261 cmavo).
- Arity/gloss/template for all curated/corpus/test words come from the in-tree tables
  *before* the data file is consulted, so those are **identical with or without** the file;
  only the non-curated long tail differs.

## Compute Backend

The gasnu (runner) acts as a TCP client to an external compute backend server via JSON Lines protocol.

- **Env var:** `NIBLI_COMPUTE_ADDR=host:port` — configures the backend address at startup
- **REPL command:** `:backend [host:port]` — show or change backend address at runtime
- **Protocol:** One JSON object per line. Request: `{"relation":"tenfa","args":[{"type":"number","value":8.0},...]}`. Response: `{"result":true}` or `{"error":"..."}`.
- **Fallback:** Built-in arithmetic (pilji/sumji/dilcu) always handled locally. Unknown predicates forward to external backend. If no backend configured, returns error.
  - **Tolerant equality (disclosed):** pilji/sumji/dilcu compare the result with `isclose` (rel_tol `1e-9`, abs_tol `0`) — a deliberate float approximation so `0.3 = 0.1 + 0.2` is TRUE — in the single shared evaluator `nibli-types/src/arithmetic.rs` (logji guest + gasnu host + `nibli_backend.py` all mirror it). The equality predicate `dunli` is EXACT `==` (`logji/src/compute.rs`). README's "Compute Backend" discloses this to users.
- **Lazy connection:** TCP connects on first external dispatch, auto-reconnects on failure.
- **Trusted oracle (disclosed):** a backend `true` reply is AUTO-ASSERTED as a ground fact mid-query (`assert_typed_fact`), which downstream rules then chain on — the backend is part of the trusted computing base, an axiom source, NOT a derivation. See the TRUST BOUNDARY note at `logji/src/lib.rs` and `logji/src/compute.rs`. README's "What zero-hallucination means here" + "Compute Backend" disclose this to users.
- **Reference server:** `python/nibli_backend.py` — handles pilji, sumji, dilcu, tenfa (exponent), dugri (log). Extend via `HANDLERS` dict.

## Architecture

Core component crates + runtime surfaces:

| Crate | Lojban meaning | Role | Key files |
|-------|---------------|------|-----------|
| `gerna` | grammar | Lojban text -> AST -> flat WIT buffer; shared `go'i` pro-bridi resolver | `grammar.rs`, `ast.rs`, `lib.rs` (flattener), `lexer.rs`, `goi.rs` (`resolve_go_i`, shared by lasna + nibli-engine) |
| `smuni` | meaning | Flat AST buffer -> FOL logic IR -> flat WIT logic buffer | `semantic.rs`, `ir.rs`, `lib.rs` (flattener) |
| `logji` | logic | FOL logic buffer -> backward-chaining assert/query | `lib.rs` (single file, all logic) |
| `lasna` | fasten/connect | Glue: chains gerna -> smuni -> logji | `lib.rs` |
| `gasnu` | agent/doer | Native Wasmtime host, REPL, external compute backend TCP client | `main.rs` |
| `nibli-engine` | — | Native in-process embedding of the pipeline (used by tests + the store layer; no Wasmtime). Stateful prior-bridi snapshot resolves `go'i` identically to lasna (shared `gerna::goi`) | `lib.rs` |
| `nibli-ui` | — | Standalone Dioxus web UI (browser, port 8080) — gerna/smuni/logji compiled in, reasons fully in-browser; optional client-side BYO-key LLM Translate (Source→Lojban), key held in-tab-memory only, no server | `main.rs`, `llm.rs` |
| `nibli-wasm` | — | wasm-bindgen wrapper exposing the in-browser pipeline (powers the live demo) | `lib.rs` |
| `nibli` | — | Native debug REPL and `nibli-validate` tooling | `main.rs`, `src/bin/validate.rs` |
| `nibli-verify` | — | Differential SOUNDNESS gate (Track A), two oracles: exports the smuni FOL IR (`LogicBuffer`) and checks nibli's verdict against (1) **Vampire** over the Horn/NAF-free fragment (TPTP), and (2) **clingo** over the stratified-NAF + closed-world fragment (ASP — the translator regroups the event decomposition back to function-free surface Datalog). Plus (3) a **gerna→smuni compiler-seam** check (`seam.rs`) — compiles source text end-to-end and checks the FOL against hand-verified structure + metamorphic invariants (no solver). Plus (4) a **gerna↔camxes parse-differential** (`parser_diff.rs`, `just verify-parser`) — gerna-accepted sentences must parse under the official grammar (ilmentufa via node). Not a runtime surface — a CI gate | `lib.rs`, `tptp.rs`, `asp.rs`, `filter.rs`, `oracle.rs`, `oracle_asp.rs`, `seam.rs`, `parser_diff.rs`, `strat_diff.rs`, `retract_diff.rs`, `tense.rs`, `corpus.rs`, `corpus_naf.rs` |
| `python/` | — | Reference compute backend server (TCP + JSON Lines) | `nibli_backend.py` |

- **WIT interfaces:** `wit/world.wit` defines only the SHIPPING component's boundary: `logic-types` (FOL IR), `error-types`, `compute-backend` (host import), `lasna` (session export). `cargo component build -p lasna` regenerates `lasna/src/bindings.rs` (the ONLY crate with WIT bindings; gerna/smuni/logji are plain Rust libs using `nibli-types` directly).
- **WIT worlds:** `lasna-pipeline` is the SOLE world — a single WASM component importing `compute-backend`, exporting `lasna`, with gerna/smuni/logji linked as internal Rust crate deps. (The legacy per-stage `gerna-component`/`smuni-component`/`logji-component` worlds + `gerna`/`smuni`/`logji`/`ast-types` interfaces were removed — they were never built and misled contributors into thinking a per-component architecture existed.)
- **Rust structs:** `LasnaPipeline` (the WASM component) is the only WIT-binding struct.
- **Boundary data:** Flat index-based arrays (`LogicBuffer` for `:debug`/proof output, `LogicalTerm` args) with `u32` indices cross the SINGLE host↔lasna WASM boundary — no heap pointers. The internal gerna→smuni→logji stages are Rust function calls (no WASM boundary), using `nibli-types` flat buffers directly.
- **Compute dispatch:** logji uses injectable function pointers (`logji::register_compute_dispatch`) instead of cfg-gated WIT imports. Lasna registers host-bridge functions at Session creation; native (nibli-engine) and in-browser (nibli-ui/nibli-wasm) modes leave dispatch unregistered — built-in arithmetic (pilji/sumji/dilcu) still resolves locally, external predicates (tenfa/dugri) return an error.

## Canonical Runtime Surfaces

Use these assumptions when selecting entrypoints:

- `gasnu` is the canonical local/operator runtime for the theorem prover. It is the main single-node REPL and the default way to exercise the WASM-hosted pipeline.
  - **Strict mode:** `NIBLI_STRICT=1` (or `:strict on|off` at runtime) makes arity mismatches and integrity-constraint violations REJECT the offending fact and fail the assertion atomically, instead of the default permissive warn-and-insert (GUARANTEES §Predicate Validation / §Integrity Constraints). Plumbing pinned by the `smoke-gasnu-strict` gate (in `ci-wasm`); rejection behavior pinned at the logji level.
  - **Quiet mode:** `NIBLI_QUIET=1` suppresses the per-assertion bookkeeping echoes — `[Fact #N] …` (host) plus `[Skolem]`/`[Rule]`/`[Constraint]` (guest; gasnu forwards the flag into the component's WASI env, since `lasna::Session::new` reads it to decide `kb.set_verbose`). The verdict, `[Why]`, proof trace, `[Find]`, `[Note: …]`, `[Retract]`, and `:facts` output are unaffected. Opt-in — a live `just run` REPL stays verbose. The book's capture harness (`book/tools/capture_book.py`) sets it by default for clean transcripts; the `smoke-gasnu-quiet` gate (in `ci-wasm`) pins both directions.
- `nibli-ui` is the canonical browser frontend — a standalone Dioxus app with the engine (gerna→smuni→logji) compiled into the WASM bundle. It reasons fully in-browser; there is no server. The one optional network call is the Source→Lojban **Translate** (`nibli-ui/src/llm.rs`): a bring-your-own-key request sent directly from the browser to a user-chosen LLM (Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter/Gemini/Custom), with the key held in tab memory only.
  - **Query model (state, don't ask):** a query is an entailment check of a *proposition* — you state `la .adam. cu citka` ("Adam eats") and the engine returns `TRUE`/`FALSE`/`UNKNOWN`. There is no interrogative form: `xu`/"Does Adam eat?" is **not** a query (`xu la .adam. cu citka` is a parse error). The `xu` shown in the UI query box is a decorative reading cue — not part of `query_text`, never sent to the engine. Keep UI/docs/book copy phrased as "state a claim," never "ask a question."
  - **Example dropdown:** the header offers preloaded book KBs (`nibli-ui/src/examples.rs` — Syllogism/GDPR/Drug-interactions; GDPR+drug corpora `include_str!`-ed from the repo-root `*.lojban` files the `gdpr_*`/`ddi_*` tests pin). Selecting one is read-only (Translate disabled) and turns the query box into a preset-query dropdown that auto-runs; default **Custom** (`example == None`) is the editable mode. The `example` signal lives in `App` and is rendered *conditionally* — Custom buffers are never overwritten.
- `nibli-wasm` is the wasm-bindgen wrapper exposing the same in-browser pipeline to JS (powers the live demo at dhilipsiva.dev/nibli).
- `nibli-engine` is an internal native embedding library, not a user-facing runtime surface.
- `nibli` is developer tooling: a native direct-crate REPL and the `nibli-validate` binary used for validation/data-generation workflows. It is not the canonical production runtime.

## Code Conventions

- Gerna (parser) tests use `as_bridi(&r.sentences[0])` helper to unwrap `Sentence::Simple`
- Grammar tests use `parse_ok()` / `parse_err()` + token constructors `cmavo()`, `gismu()`
- Smuni (semantics) tests use `compile_one(selbris, sumtis, bridi)` helper returning `(LogicalForm, SemanticCompiler)`
- `resolve(&compiler, &spur)` helper to get string from interner in tests
- Connective enums (Je/Ja/Jo/Ju) are shared between selbri and sumti connectives
- BAI tags map to underlying gismu: ri'a->rinka, ni'i->nibli, mu'i->mukti, ki'u->krinu, pi'o->pilno, ba'i->basti
- **Test discipline — flat vs surface (logji):** logji's flat `make_*` test helpers hand-build bare `LogicBuffer`s and skip smuni's event decomposition + `transform_compute_nodes`, so they match the shipped pipeline on *verdicts* but NOT on shape-dependent behavior (`cwa_false`/`naf_dependent` flags, the `ComputeCheck` step, witness/Skolem shape). For anything shape-dependent, build the buffer the real way via `compile_surface("<lojban>")` (a logji test helper = `gerna::parse_checked` → `smuni::compile_from_gerna_ast` → `transform_compute_nodes`), or use the `make_decomposed_*` helpers, or write a `nibli-engine` integration test — never assert those on a bare flat buffer. `logji/src/tests.rs`'s `mod flat_vs_surface` is a metamorphic guard that keeps every behavior class' flat verdict == the surface verdict; keep it green. (See the header comment above the flat helpers in `logji/src/tests.rs`.)

## Codebase Exclusions

When analyzing or searching the codebase:
- **Exclude `docs/` folder** — generated/reference documentation, not source
- **Exclude `**/bindings.rs`** — auto-generated by `cargo component build`, not hand-written
- **`proofs/`** is Lean 4, not Rust — the mechanized soundness proofs (Track B; `proofs/README.md`). Each `.lean` mirrors a Rust component and is kept in lock-step with an exhaustive Rust conformance test. Checked by `just verify-proofs`.

## Known Issues

- `cargo component build` fails on `io-extras` crate — pre-existing, unrelated to our changes. Bindings generate before the failure.
- **rustc ICE in `check_mod_deathness`** — `wasmtime::component::bindgen!` macro triggers compiler panic in library crates (not binary crates like gasnu). Workaround: `#![allow(dead_code)]` at crate root in nibli-engine. Fixed in rustc 1.94.0 (updated via flake).
## Roadmap

The **soundness-by-proof frontier is complete** (P1–P4 gaps cleared; P5 done): Track A ships two
differential gates — **Vampire** (classical FOL, Horn/NAF-free) and **clingo** (ASP, stratified-NAF
+ closed-world, incl. the GDPR deontic-NAF erasure rule) — and Track B ships **six mechanized Lean 4
proofs** of the soundness-critical core (combiner, stratification criterion, SCC decomposition,
unifier, rule firing, and the capstone *trace ⇒ perfect-model* theorem), each bridged to the engine
by a conformance test (`proofs/README.md`; `just verify-soundness` + `just verify-proofs`). The
remaining ceiling is **adoption**, not engine code — chiefly a reproducible non-Lojbanist authoring
study (round-trip fidelity + silent-mistranslation rate), which belongs to the book/UX track.
