## Deferred / Low Priority

- **Async compute backend** — Current synchronous TCP + JSON Lines protocol is a bottleneck only under heavy external predicate use. Built-in arithmetic bypasses TCP entirely, and auto-ingestion caches results. Move to async (tokio) + binary IPC if external dispatch frequency becomes a real bottleneck.
